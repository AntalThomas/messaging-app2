# Struggles
If I could redo it again I would prefer to not use React just yet. I am just not experienced enough with it. If I just went with a SPA just using NodeJS and Express I would've had a smoother development experience.
User authentication and use of async/await functions was a massive issue for me early on.

I struggled so much I decided to start again and just recreate the app as an SPA without React.
